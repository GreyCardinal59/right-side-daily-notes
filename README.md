## Usage

Tranfers content of your daily notes to the right panel, prohibiting the output into the main content area.

When switching from an active entry to a daily note in the main area, you will remain on the first one.

Interaction between notes and Calendar plugin is still available. If, for some reason, you still need to display daily note content in the main area, double-click the Calendar element.

## TODO

- Fix behavior with Canvas and custom areas
- Improve the icon logic
